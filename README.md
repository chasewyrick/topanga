# to.panga for iOS 11 (up to 11.1.2) [a WIP project for devs only]

## Note: I will not be providing updates anymore since many other projects already achieve the same goal. Au revoir!
## To remove: open the application then tap 'remove'. Note: you will need to trigger uicache afterwards to make 'Cydia' and 'jjjj' icons disappear.
